# Plato

A little robot pet I'm making for my fiancee :)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Oh god, so many things...

## Deployment

Sorry, what goes into Plato is genetic and unobtainable. But I guess you could run this code on any robot you happen to have.

## Built With

* Raspberry Pi 4b - The brain of Plato
